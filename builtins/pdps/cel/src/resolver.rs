// evaluates it against the policy `AttributeBag` on every call.
//
// # Decision contract
//
//   - expression → `true`   → Allow
//   - expression → `false`  → Deny  (a legitimate policy denial; always honored)
//   - non-boolean result, undeclared-variable reference, or any other

//     fail-closed). `on_error: allow` flips these degenerate cases to Allow.
//   - a `cel:` step with no `expr` string is a config bug → `PdpError`.
//
// The cause of any Deny / error is recorded in `PdpDecision.diagnostics`
// for audit, and is the `rule_source` on the resulting Deny.
