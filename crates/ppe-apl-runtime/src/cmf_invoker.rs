// `HookPluginInvoker<H>` — `praxis-policy-apl-core::PluginInvoker` impl bound to
// one hook family. Drives dispatch off a pre-resolved [`RouteDispatchPlan`]
// (from [`DispatchCache`]) and forwards entries to
// `PolicyEngine::invoke_entries::<H>(...)`, which runs the full
// executor pipeline (sequential / transform / audit / concurrent /
// fire-and-forget; on_error / timeouts / mode / write tokens all
// honored). Compile-time payload type safety is provided by the
// `H: HookTypeDef` bound on `invoke_entries`.
//
// # One invoker, one family per instance
//
// [`CmfPluginInvoker`] and [`HttpPluginInvoker`] are the two aliases in
// use: a route's entity type picks which one a request builds, so a plugin
// on an HTTP route is handed an `HttpPayload` rather than a fabricated chat
// message. The generic is erased the moment the invoker becomes
// `Arc<dyn PluginInvoker>`, which carries no payload, so the APL evaluator
// sees one type either way.
//
// # Request-scoped vs session-scoped state
//
// The invoker carries **request-scoped** state — payload + extensions
// — under interior mutability (`Arc<tokio::sync::Mutex<_>>`) so mutations
// from one plugin call accumulate for the next call in the same
// request. **Session-scoped** state (labels that survive across requests
// in the same session) goes through the pluggable [`SessionStore`]
// trait: hydrated at `for_request` start, persisted via
// [`persist_session`] after route evaluation. Session ID is pulled from
// `extensions.agent.session_id`; absent → both ops are no-ops.
//
// Alongside the payload, the invoker records *whether* a plugin ever
// handed back a payload ([`payload_was_modified`]). That flag is the
// authoritative answer for the host: a plugin mutation is only
// detectable at the moment it's accepted, not by comparing message
// content afterwards (content comparison can't see mutations to
// non-text parts, and equality isn't defined on the CMF payload types).
//
// # Per-call taint extraction
//
// Each plugin invocation diffs `result.modified_extensions.security.labels`
// against the labels visible to *that call*. New labels become
// `PluginOutcome.taints` as `TaintEvent { scopes: vec![Session] }` —
// CMF's monotonic label channel is session-semantic by design, so
// Session is the natural default. Multi-scope plugin emissions (or
// `Message` scope) require either a future second label channel in
// Extensions or explicit config-side `Step::Taint { scopes: [...] }` /
// `Stage::Taint`.
//
// # Lifetime model
//
// One invoker instance per request. Host pre-builds the family's
// payload, hydrates session-scoped state via `for_request`
// (which is async because it awaits `SessionStore::load_labels`), then
// drives `evaluate_route`. After evaluation, host calls
// [`current_payload`] for body re-serialization and
// [`persist_session`] to commit accumulated session state.
//
// Background tasks returned by `invoke_entries` are dropped for v0;
// when audit/fire-and-forget plugin support is wired into APL's
// lifecycle, we'll thread a `BackgroundTasks` aggregator through the
// invoker.
