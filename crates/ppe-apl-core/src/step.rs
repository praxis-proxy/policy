// Policy-phase Step IR and async dispatch traits.
//
// The DSL allows pre_invocation:/post_invocation: lists to contain three kinds of
// entries beyond predicate-and-action rules:
//
//   - PDP calls: `cedar:(...)`, `opa(...)`, `authzen(...)`, `nemo(...)`,
//     `cel:(...)` with optional `on_deny:` / `on_allow:` reaction blocks
//   - Plugin invocations: `run(name)`
//   - Taint effects: `taint(label[, scope])`
//
// `Step` is the union over these forms plus the existing `Rule`. The async
// `evaluate_steps` function walks a Step list, dispatching PDP calls via
// `PdpResolver` and plugin calls via `PluginInvoker`. Taint dispatch is
// recognized but no-op in praxis-policy-apl-core — actual SessionStore writes happen in
// `praxis-policy-apl-runtime`, which has access to that machinery.
//
// Covers effects, PDP integration, and the PdpResolver seam.
