// `RawCredentialsExtension` — Layer 3 of the three-layer credential
// storage model.
// Carries the *raw* token material — bearer JWTs, opaque session
// strings, SPIFFE-JWT-SVIDs, UCAN tokens, transaction tokens — that
// IdentityResolve and TokenDelegate handlers need to do their jobs.
//
// # Why this is its own extension
//
// `SubjectExtension` / `ClientExtension` / `WorkloadIdentity` carry
// *validated* identity — claims already extracted, signature already
// checked, scopes already enumerated. Most plugins want that and
// nothing more. A small set of plugins (identity resolvers, token
// exchangers, forwarding proxies) genuinely need the raw material to
// re-attach it to outbound calls or hand it to an introspection
// endpoint. Separating raw from validated lets us gate the raw layer
// behind narrowly-scoped capabilities (`read_inbound_credentials`,
// `read_delegated_tokens`) so a buggy or malicious plugin without
// those caps can't get at credential strings.
//
// # Serialization safety
//
// `RawInboundToken.token` and `RawDelegatedToken.token` are
// `#[serde(skip)]`. Any normal serialization of an `Extensions` —
// debug dumps, audit logs, trace snapshots, hot-reload bundles —
// produces JSON / YAML where the token field is absent. A deserialize
// then yields a struct with `Zeroizing::new(String::new())` as the
// token, which is explicitly safe (empty bearer authenticates
// nowhere) but a deliberate foot-gun: a plugin that deserializes an
// extension snapshot and expects to find a working token will fail
// loudly, not silently leak credentials by accident.
//
// # Where the process boundary actually is
//
// The `#[serde(skip)]` guard is a guard on *these types*, not a
// guarantee about the host process. It means no generic path that
// serializes an `Extensions` — the `extensions` wire channel to an
// out-of-process host, audit dumps, trace snapshots, hot-reload
// bundles — can carry token bytes. That much is absolute: a plugin
// reading `extensions.raw_credentials` out-of-process sees structure
// and metadata with empty token strings.
//
// It is **not** true that raw material never leaves the host process.
// A host may read the in-memory `Zeroizing` field directly and put
// the plaintext on a purpose-built side channel. An out-of-process host
// bridge does exactly that: it builds a dedicated `credential` DTO carrying
// the token as a plain string, so an identity resolver or token delegator can
// run in a separate worker process. The reversal is deliberate — without it
// those two handler kinds cannot work out-of-process at all — and it
// is narrow by construction, not by policy: the DTO is a distinct
// type with a hand-written redacting `Debug`, and it is the only
// serialize site anywhere that emits token bytes.
//
// ## What gates the crossing
//
// Raw material may cross a process boundary only when all of these
// hold. They are conditions on the host's dispatch path, not
// properties of this module:
//
// - **The plugin declared the matching capability** —
//   `read_inbound_credentials` for inbound tokens,
//   `read_delegated_tokens` for delegated ones. The two are
//   independently scoped; neither unlocks the other.
// - **The hook is one of the two that model a raw token** —
//   `identity.resolve` (`IdentityPayload.raw_token`) and
//   `token.delegate` (`DelegationPayload.bearer_token`). Every other
//   hook gets nothing, even for a plugin holding both capabilities.
// - **Fail closed on both sides of the gate.** No declared capability
//   means no DTO and no token bytes — silently, not as an error.
//   A declared capability that cannot be honored (no extension, no
//   matching token, an empty or whitespace-only token) is an error
//   rather than a no-token dispatch, because a resolver handed an
//   empty bearer may read it as "no authentication required".
//
// ## Residual exposure
//
// The gate decides *which plugin* receives a token. It does not
// constrain what happens after: once the plaintext is resident in a
// worker process, every transitively-installed dependency in that
// worker's environment can read it. That is a materially larger and
// less audited trust boundary than this process, and neither the
// capability gate nor the transport closes it — sending raw
// credentials out-of-process means accepting that dependency tree
// into the credential trust boundary.
//
// The mitigations are real but modest, and should not be read as
// closing that gap. The transport is a private pipe inherited only by
// the child (no listening socket, so no other local process can read
// it), the DTO redacts in `Debug`, and the capability gate narrows the
// blast radius to plugins that asked. None of that helps once a
// malicious or compromised dependency shares the worker's address
// space. Keeping the audit story simple is a reason to prefer
// in-process handlers, not an invariant the framework enforces.
//
// # Memory hygiene
//
// `Zeroizing<String>` wipes the underlying bytes when the struct is
// dropped. The protection is real but not absolute — bytes can still
// leak via String::clone, format!, or temporaries created on the way
// to the wrapper. Treat tokens as best-effort cleared, not
// guaranteed.
