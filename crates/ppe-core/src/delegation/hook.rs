// `TokenDelegateHook` — the `HookTypeDef` marker for the
// TokenDelegate hook family. Plugins implement
// `HookHandler<TokenDelegateHook>`; outbound code dispatches into it
// to mint a downstream-scoped credential for the call it's about to
// make.
//
// Single hook name (for now): `"token.delegate"`. Future variants
// with the same payload shape — e.g. `"token.refresh"` for a
// refresh-token specific flow — could share `TokenDelegateHook` via
// multi-name registration. Variants with different payloads get
// their own hook type rather than reusing this one.
