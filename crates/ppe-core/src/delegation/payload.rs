// `DelegationPayload` — the unified state struct threaded through the
// TokenDelegate hook chain. Same input/output split pattern as
// `IdentityPayload`:
//
//   * **Input** (private — host-supplied, never mutated by handlers) —
//     `bearer_token`, `actor_token`, `actor_role`, `subject`, `target_name`,
//     `target_type`, `target_audience`, `required_permissions`,
//     `trust_domain`, `auth_enforced_by`,
//     `route_attenuation`. Set once at the call site that needs to mint
//     a downstream credential. Privacy is enforced at the module
//     boundary: external code reads through accessors and has no
//     setters or mutable field access.
//
//   * **Accumulating output** (`pub` fields) — `delegated_token` and
//     `delegation_update`. Handlers clone the payload, populate these,
//     return the updated payload via `PluginResult::modify_payload`.
//
// # Where this hook fits
//
// IdentityResolve is *inbound* — validates the caller's
// credentials at request entry, populates `security.subject` /
// `security.client` / `security.caller_workload`. TokenDelegate is
// *outbound* — when a plugin (typically a forwarding proxy) needs to
// make a downstream call to a tool or agent, it asks for an
// appropriately-scoped credential for that target. A handler (RFC
// 8693 token exchanger, UCAN minter, passthrough) produces the
// minted token; the framework stashes it in
// `Extensions.raw_credentials.delegated_tokens` for the proxy plugin
// to attach on the upstream request.
//
// # Caching
//
// Not done here. A handler may reuse a token it already minted, and
// `praxis-policy-plugin-delegator-oauth` does, but the key deciding when two
// delegations are the same belongs to the handler: only it knows what
// went into its own mint, so a generic wrapper that dropped a field the
// handler used would serve a token minted under different terms.
//
// Keying on audience and scopes alone is the trap to avoid. Neither
// names a principal, so one entry would serve every caller of a route.
// See `cache::key` in the OAuth delegator for a derivation that holds.
//
// # Rejection
//
// Same as IdentityResolve: handlers reject via
// `PluginResult::deny(PluginViolation::new(code, reason))`. The
// executor halts the chain; no later handler runs and the request
// fails with the violation surfaced to the host. No `rejected` flag
// on the payload.
