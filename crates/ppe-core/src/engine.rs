// The policy engine.
//
// Loads the policy document, owns the extensions it declares and their lifecycle
// (initialize, dispatch, shutdown), and evaluates a request against the policy.
// Managing plugins is part of that, not the whole of it.
//
// Two invoke paths:
//
// - `invoke::<H>()` — typed dispatch for Rust callers. Zero-cost.
//   The hook type is known at compile time; no registry lookup or
//   downcast needed for the payload.
//
// - `invoke_by_name()` — dynamic dispatch for Python/Go/WASM callers.
//   Hook name resolved from the registry; payload passed as
//   Box<dyn PluginPayload>.
//
// The engine reads plugin configs from the config loader and wraps each plugin in
// a PluginRef with the authoritative config. A plugin never supplies its own
// config. Trust flows:
//   config loader → engine → PluginRef → executor
