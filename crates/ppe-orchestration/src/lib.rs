// Async concurrency primitives shared by the PPE runtime.

// Two callers today, both running "N async branches concurrently with
// optional short-circuit on first deny":
//
//   * `praxis-policy-core::executor::run_concurrent_phase` — fans out concurrent
//     plugins for one hook event
//   * `praxis-policy-apl-core::evaluator::dispatch_parallel` — fans out the effects
//     inside an APL `parallel:` block
//
// Both want the same mechanics — `tokio::task::JoinSet` keyed by task
// id, react-to-results-as-they-arrive, optional `abort_all` on first
// deny, per-branch timeout. Without a shared primitive, both would
// reinvent the pattern (slightly differently) and drift.
//
// This crate exposes a single generic function `run_branches`. It
// speaks `Future<Output = T>` + an `is_deny` predicate — no domain
// concepts. Each caller adapts its types (HookEntry, EffectOutcome,
// Decision, …) at the boundary.

//! Runs N async branches concurrently, optionally aborting the rest on the
//! first deny.
//!
//! One generic function, [`run_branches`], shared by the core executor's
//! concurrent phase and the APL evaluator's `parallel:` block so the two cannot
//! drift. It speaks `Future` plus an `is_deny` predicate and knows nothing about
//! policy.

/// # Behaviour
///
/// * Each branch is spawned onto the current tokio runtime via
///   `JoinSet::spawn`. The runtime must be `rt-multi-thread` for the
///   branches to actually run in parallel; single-threaded runtimes
///   will run them concurrently (interleaved) but on one OS thread.
/// * If `config.short_circuit_on_deny` is set, the moment any branch
///   completes with a result satisfying `is_deny`, all remaining
///   branches are aborted via `JoinSet::abort_all`. They surface as
///   `BranchOutcome::Aborted`.
/// * If `config.timeout_per_branch` is set, each branch is wrapped in
///   `tokio::time::timeout`. Timeouts surface as `BranchOutcome::TimedOut`.
/// * Panics inside a branch are caught (tokio's `JoinSet` returns
///   them via `JoinError::is_panic`) and surfaced as
///   `BranchOutcome::Panicked` rather than re-panicking — the
///   intent is that one misbehaving branch shouldn't take down the
///   whole orchestrator.
///
/// # Cost notes
///
/// * `tokio::task::spawn` has ~1 µs overhead per spawn — fine for
///   the workload sizes this is designed for (typically 2-20
///   branches). If you need 1000+ branches, profile first.
/// * Each branch's future is `Send + 'static` (it's spawned onto a
///   task) — captured state must satisfy those bounds. Most callers
///   handle this by cloning state per branch before constructing the
///   future.
