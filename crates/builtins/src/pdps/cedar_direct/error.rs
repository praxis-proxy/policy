// Build-time errors for `CedarDirectResolver`. All variants fire at
// construction (parse, validate, load); never at request time.
//
// Request-time errors flow through `praxis_policy_apl_core::PdpError` because that's
// the trait's return type. The two error stories are deliberately
// separate — build errors are config faults the operator fixes once;
// request errors are per-evaluation issues the host has to handle
// continuously.
//
// `BuildError` implements `std::error::Error` (via thiserror), so it
// boxes cleanly into `praxis_policy_apl_runtime::visitor::VisitorError` when the
// AplConfigVisitor builds a resolver from a unified-config block. The
// visitor then wraps that into `praxis_policy_core::PluginError::Config` on its
// way out of `load_config_yaml`. Each layer wraps the layer below using
// its own native error type — no dep inversion required to make the
// error flow work.
