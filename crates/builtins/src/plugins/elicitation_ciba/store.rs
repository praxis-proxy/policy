// Correlation store — maps an elicitation id (the CIBA `auth_req_id`,
// which the agent echoes on retry) to the state the handler needs across
// the dispatch → check → validate lifetime: who the *expected* approver is
// (`login_hint`, set at dispatch) and, once `check` sees a successful poll,
// who *actually* approved (the approver claim extracted from the OP token).
//
// # Why we store the extracted claim, not the token
//
// CIBA hands the token back exactly once (a second poll on the same
// `auth_req_id` fails), and `validate` runs on a later request than
// `check` — so the relevant fact must be carried across. We extract the
// approver claim at `check` and store *that string*, then drop the token.
// `validate` compares the two stored strings (expected vs resolved); it
// never needs the token. This keeps a **bearer credential out of the
// store at rest** — so even a leaked/co-tenant store reveals only "who
// approved what," never a usable token. (The `require_step_up` path,
// which forwards the CIBA token, is separate and does not use this store.)
//
// v1 is in-process (`InMemoryCorrelationStore`). That survives retries
// within one gateway process — enough for a single-node demo. The trait
// is the seam for a Valkey-backed store (cross-node / cross-restart) —
// deferred; when added, the CIBA store should use its own instance or an
// ACL-scoped user so it is isolated from the session-store keyspace.
