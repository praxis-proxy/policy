# Configuration

A PPE config is a single document that declares the plugins and PDP resolvers
available, the global settings, and the APL routes. The runtime loads it and the
APL visitor wires routes to hooks.

## Shape

```yaml
plugins:        # the plugins available to policy, by kind
  - name: ...
    kind: ...
    hooks: [...]
    capabilities: [...]
    config: { ... }

global:         # cross-cutting resolvers and stores
  apl:
    pdp:
      - kind: ...
    session_store:
      kind: ...

routes:         # APL policy, a list of operations
  - tool: <name>            # or resource: / prompt: / llm:
    authentication: [ ... ] # identity-resolution plugins
    args: { ... }
    authorization:
      pre_invocation: [ ... ]
      post_invocation: [ ... ]
    result: { ... }
```

## Plugins

Each plugin entry declares how it is identified, where it runs, and what it may
see:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `name` | Instance name, referenced from APL (`plugin(name)`, `delegate(name, ...)`). |
| `kind` | Which plugin implementation (for example `identity/jwt`, `audit/logger`). |
| `hooks` | The hook points it registers on. |
| `mode` | Execution mode (see [Plugins & Pipeline](pipeline.md)). |
| `priority` | Order within a hook; lower runs first. |
| `on_error` | `fail`, `ignore`, or `disable`. |
| `capabilities` | Declared context access (see [Extensions & Capability-Gating](extensions.md)). |
| `config` | Plugin-specific settings. |

```yaml
plugins:
  - name: jwt-user
    kind: identity/jwt
    hooks: [identity.resolve]
    config:
      role: user
      header: X-User-Token
      trusted_issuers:
        - issuer: "https://idp.example.com/realms/agents"
          audiences: ["ppe-gateway"]
          decoding_key:
            kind: jwks_url
            url: "https://idp.example.com/realms/agents/protocol/openid-connect/certs"

  - name: audit-log
    kind: audit/logger
    hooks: [cmf.tool_pre_invoke]
    priority: 90
    capabilities: [read_subject, read_client, read_delegation]
```

## Global

`global.apl.pdp` registers PDP resolvers; `global.apl.session_store` selects
where taint labels live (absent it, the in-process memory store is used).

```yaml
global:
  apl:
    pdp:
      - kind: cedar-direct
        policy_text: |
          permit(principal, action == Action::"read", resource is Repo)
          when { principal.roles.contains("security") };
    session_store:
      kind: valkey
      endpoint: localhost:6379
```

## Routes

Routes carry the APL policy. The runtime loads routes as a **list**, one entry
per operation, matched by `tool:` (or `resource:` / `prompt:` / `llm:`):

```yaml
routes:
  - tool: get_compensation
    authorization:
      pre_invocation:
        - "require(role.hr)"
        - "delegate(workday-oauth, target: workday-api, audience: workday-api, permissions: [read_compensation])"
        - "taint(secret, session)"
        - "plugin(audit-log)"
    result:
      ssn: "str | redact(!perm.view_ssn)"
```

Within a route, the two authorization phases may be written nested under
`authorization:` (as above) or flat, as `pre_invocation:` / `post_invocation:`
directly on the route; the two are equivalent.

> **Runtime config vs. apl-core.** The `praxis-policy-apl-core` crate also
> accepts a map-keyed `routes:` form (keyed by route name) through its
> standalone `compile_config` entry point, used mainly in tests. The runtime
> host path (`load_config_yaml`) does not: it parses the list form shown here.
> Write the list form for anything you load into a running PPE. See
> [APL](apl/README.md) for the policy syntax itself.

Route-level overrides can adjust a plugin's `capabilities` or `config` for a
specific operation, so a scanner can be granted `read_labels` on one sensitive
route without widening its access everywhere.

## Groups

A **group** is a named, reusable bundle of policy — `authentication:` steps,
`authorization:` steps, and/or `plugins` — that routes opt into. It is the
middle layer between global defaults and per-route policy. Define groups at the
top-level `groups:` section, keyed by name:

```yaml
groups:
  hr-tools:
    authentication: [jwt-manager]        # + identity for this group
    authorization:
      pre_invocation:
        - "require(role.hr)"             # + policy for this group
```

A route joins a group with the `groups:` field — a bare string or a list:

```yaml
routes:
  - tool: get_compensation
    groups: hr-tools                     # or: groups: [hr-tools, pii]
```

`groups:` is **sugar over tags**: `meta: { tags: [hr-tools] }` is exactly
equivalent, and a host-injected runtime tag joins a group the same way when its
name matches a group. Tags remain the substrate — `groups:` just names the
common "join this bundle" case as a first-class field.

## Global settings and defaults

Every top-level section (`plugins`, `global`, `routes`, `plugin_dirs`,
`plugin_settings`) is optional. `plugin_settings` controls runtime behavior:

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `routing_enabled` | `false` | `false`: each plugin self-selects via its own `conditions:`. `true`: `routes:` / `global:` drive selection and per-plugin `conditions:` are ignored. Route-based configs set this `true`. |
| `plugin_timeout` | `30` | Per-plugin timeout, in seconds. |
| `short_circuit_on_deny` | `true` | Stop a hook's remaining plugins once one denies. |
| `fail_on_plugin_error` | `false` | Whether a plugin error fails the request (see also per-plugin `on_error`). |
| `parallel_execution_within_band` | `false` | Run same-priority plugins concurrently. |
| `route_cache_max_entries` | `10000` | Dispatch-plan cache size. |

Per-plugin fields default to `mode: sequential`, `on_error: fail`, and a
`priority` that orders plugins within a hook (lower runs first).

## Secrets and key material

PPE does not interpolate environment variables into arbitrary config values;
there is no `${ENV}` substitution of config fields. Secrets are injected through
typed source enums on the plugins that need them.

OAuth and CIBA client secrets use `client_secret_source`:

```yaml
client_secret_source: { kind: env_var, name: OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET }  # production-friendly
client_secret_source: { kind: file, path: /run/secrets/oauth }       # mounted secret
client_secret_source: { kind: literal, secret: dev-only }            # never in production
```

JWT signing material uses `decoding_key` on each `identity/jwt` trusted issuer:
`jwks_url` (fetched and cached; `refresh_secs` default 600), `pem`, `pem_file`,
`jwk`, or `secret` (HMAC). For a `jwks_url`, `insecure_http` defaults to
`false`; set it `true` only to allow `http://` on localhost, never in
production.

(The request-time templates like `${args.X}` used inside PDP and predicate steps
are a separate mechanism, evaluated per request against the attribute bag, not
config interpolation.)

## Resolution order

With `routing_enabled: true`, the plugins that run for an operation are
assembled and de-duplicated in this order, with later layers winning on
conflict:

1. always-on global policy,
2. the entity `defaults`,
3. groups the operation joins (via `groups:` or a matching tag),
4. the route itself.

Identity (`authentication:`) plugins stack global → groups → route, with
`replace_inherited` to drop inherited layers when a route needs a clean set.

## Validation

`load_config_yaml` validates on load and fails with an operator-facing message
rather than starting in a bad state. Common errors:

- a duplicate plugin `name`;
- a route with no entity matcher, or with more than one (for example both
  `tool:` and `resource:`);
- a route or group that references an unknown plugin name;
- the renamed key `identity:` (use `authentication:`).

There is no hot reload or config versioning: load a changed config by rebuilding
the manager.
